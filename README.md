GWC SIP Final Project - Activist Toolkit: The Eco-Art Revolution

This was our final project in the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program. I used all the skills I learned throughout the two week course to put together
this activism website. My topic is the eco-art revolution, which is the fight for using environmentally friendly materials to create art. I chose this
topic because I love to paint, and I hate watching my leftover paint wash down the drain. I had recently began making my own paint, so I decided this topic
would be perfect. I hope this website encourages other artists to begin their own research into eco-art!
